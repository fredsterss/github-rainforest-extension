# github-rainforest-extension
Chrome extension to squirt Rainforest into Pull Requests

### HOW I UZE????
1. Download or clone this repo
2. In the `myscript.js` file, change `YOUR_API_KEY` by your Rainforest QA API key. **DO NOT PUBLISH THAT FILE ANYWHERE!!!**
3. Navigate to chrome://extensions/
4. Click on "Load Unpacked Extension"
5. Select the folder where you downloaded the extension

### TODO
- [ ] poll for updates on in_progress runs
- [ ] allow user to select an app / auto-select app?
- [ ] be able to configure the API key
- [ ] be able to choose the app to run against (it uses only the tag and environment for now)
- [ ] be able to add a ad-hoc URL (use case: run the suite on an ad-hoc env like a Fourchette fork)
- [ ] make it nicer (red & green for status)
- [ ] create test?

### WAT IT DO???
